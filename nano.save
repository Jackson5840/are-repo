   If `vi` is giving you issues, you can try using `nano`, which is often easier to use and does not have the same terminal-specific requirements:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/yum.repos.d/city-fan.repo
   ```

3. **Redirect Output Properly:**
   If `vi` must be used, try running it explicitly as an interactive command:
   ```bash
   sudo vi /etc/yum.repos.d/city-fan.repo </dev/tty >/dev/tty 2>&1
   ```

4. **Use `cat` and `echo` as an Alternative to Modify the File:**
   If youâ€™re still having trouble editing with `vi` or `nano`, you can directly disable the repository by modifying the file with a command like `sed`. First, ensure the file exists:
   ```bash
   sudo cat /etc/yum.repos.d/city-fan.repo
   ```

   Then, disable the repository by changing `enabled=1` to `enabled=0` using `sed`:
   ```bash
   sudo sed -i 's/enabled=1/enabled=0/' /etc/yum.repos.d/city-fan.repo
   ```

5. **Verify the Changes:**
   After editing, verify that the file has been updated correctly:
   ```bash
   cat /etc/yum.repos.d/city-fan.repo
   ```

After these changes, you should be able to proceed with `yum clean all` and `yum update -y` without errors from the `CityFan` repository.
